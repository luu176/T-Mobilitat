# T-Mobilitat Card Investigation (Barcelona)

This repository documents the ongoing reverse engineering and analysis of the T-Mobilitat card system used for public transportation in Barcelona, Spain.

## Overview

T-Mobilitat cards are used throughout Barcelona for accessing public transit services. This repository focuses on the technical structure, communication protocols, and authentication mechanisms used by the cards and their corresponding mobile app made by [Smarting](https://www.smarting.es)

**(attached is a script which acts as a reader for the CIPURSE anonymous t-mobilitat cards using their API)**

The project investigates two main card types used in the T-Mobilitat system:

- **Infineon CIPURSE-based cards** â€“ Used for most card types. **(script works for this one)**
- **MIFARE DESFire cards** â€“ Specifically used for T-Jove (students and people *under 30*'s transit plan).

## Focus Areas

- Communication flow between mobile app and card
- File structure 
- Authentication process 
- How read/write operations are handled by the mobile app

## API Communication Flow

The mobile app initiates communication with the T-Mobilitat card backend using the following endpoints:

1. `https://motorcloud.atm.smarting.es:9032/DeviceContextService/openSession`  
   *Initial session setup.*
   This is all done in gRPC HTTP/2.0, openSession is a way to tell the server to start a session for eitherreading or updating the card.

3. `https://motorcloud.atm.smarting.es:9032/SmartcardService/executeDirectOperation`  
   *Context of card to initiate authentication*
   This endpoint takes the Session ID generated by the openSession response and the card's UID (for deriving the master key) and communicate "securely" with the card. 
   
5. `https://motorcloud.atm.smarting.es:9032/SmartcardService/smartCardResponse`  
   *Receiving & Sending APDU.*  
   This request is made **4 times** for each round of authentication and communication with the card.
   First two-three rounds focuses on card SELECT and retreiving the random encrypted **[Nonce]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonce))**, then uses that and its own Nonce to
   tell the card it knows the master key and can proceed with the authentication.
   Last round takes the two file data read unencryptred in PLAIN mode even though Infineon cards support this. ðŸ¤·

## Authentication & File Access

Before any meaningful data exchange:

- The card must first be **authenticated** with the reader.
- Once authenticated, files such as `0x93` and `0x94` can be read using **PLAIN** communication mode.
- For **writing**, the card expects **MAC** communication mode. While this does not encrypt the file data, a **CMAC (8 bytes)** is appended to each write command.
- The CMAC is calculated using:
  - The file data
  - The session MAC key derived during authentication

## Key File IDs

- `0x93`: Contains relevant usage and validation data
- `0x94`: almost practically the same as the previous file (probably a backup file)
